# Programming Exercises

## Exercise 1: Name and Number Validation

1. Take input from user about their name.
2. Print "Hi, Nice to meet you <name>".
3. Take input again from the user for a random number between 1 to 100.
4. Validation rules:
   - If the number is odd, print "You have entered an odd number"
   - If the number is even, print "You have entered an even number"
   - If the number is higher than 100, print "Oops, you have input a wrong number"

**Example 1:**
```
What is your name? Tanjina
Hi, Nice to meet you Tanjina
Enter a random number between 1 to 100: 45
You have entered an odd number
```

**Example 2:**
```
What is your name? Tanjina
Hi, Nice to meet you Tanjina
Enter a random number between 1 to 100: 140
Oops, you have input a wrong number
```

## Exercise 2: Circle Area Calculation

1. Create a function `areaOfCircle(r)` that calculates the area of a circle using the formula: π * r²
2. The function should take only the radius as a parameter
3. Input the radius from the user
4. Call the function and return the area of the circle
5. Print the result

**Example:**
```
Enter the radius of the circle: 5
The area of the circle: 78.525
```

## Exercise 3: Weight Category Counter

Given the list:
```python
weight = [45, 59, 90, 32, 56, 43, 41, 99, 55, 56, 78, 43, 31, 33, 98]
```

1. Loop through the weights
2. Count people in different categories:
   - Under 55 (Skinny)
   - Over 55 but under 65 (Healthy)
   - Over 65 (Fat)
3. Print the count for each category

**Example:**
```
Skinny people are: 7
Healthy people are: 3
Fat people are: 4
```

## Exercise 4: Mathematical Functions

1. Create a function for addition
2. Create a function for average
3. Create a function for triangle area
4. Take two numbers from the user
5. Calculate:
   - Addition of two numbers
   - Average of two numbers
   - Area of triangle using the two numbers
6. Print all results

**Example:**
```
Enter first number: 20
Enter second number: 10
Addition: 30
Average: 15
Area of triangle: 100
```
